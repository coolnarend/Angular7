				(IMP: Observables are a feature added by some other third party package not by Angular but heavily used by Angular which allow you to easily work with asynchronous tasks. Asynchronoues tasks here means the data of selected property might change in the future if user performs some action. But we don't know When that action will happen or we don't know if it will happen or how long would it take to happen. So therefore one cannot block his code and wait for that action to happen because there is a possibility that it might never happen. So an obervable is an easy way to subscribe to some event which might happen in the future to then execute some code when it happens without having to wait for it to happen.)
